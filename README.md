<summary><h2>üë®‚ÄçüíªProject Overview</h2></summary>

In this lab, I created a network environment using VirtualBox, featuring multiple virtual machines all interconnected within a single network. The key components of this setup include:

- <strong>Network Diagram:</strong> A visual layout of the entire network infrastructure to illustrate the relationships between virtual machines and the flow of data.
- <strong>Splunk Server:</strong> A dedicated virtual machine set up to collect and analyze telemetry data from the Windows machines. Splunk is configured to process and visualize data, aiding in the detection of malicious activities.
- <strong>Windows 10 Server & Host Computer:</strong> Both machines have Sysmon configured to collect detailed system telemetry, which is then forwarded to the Splunk server for analysis.
- <strong>Active Directory Domain Controller:</strong> The backbone of the network, this server manages the domain, users, and security policies, allowing for the exploration and learning of Active Directory fundamentals.
- <strong>Kali Linux Attacker:</strong> A virtual machine configured to simulate attacks on the host computer, generating detectable events that can be analyzed using Splunk.

<summary><h2>Key Learnings</h2></summary>

From completing this project, I have gained:

- <strong>Hands-on experience with Active Directory:</strong> Understanding how to set up and manage an Active Directory domain, including user management, group policies, and domain security.
- <strong>Proficiency in Sysmon configuration:</strong> Learning how to configure Sysmon to collect detailed event data on Windows systems, and understanding the significance of different event types for security monitoring.
- <strong>Skills in Splunk for security analysis:</strong> Configuring Splunk to ingest, process, and visualize telemetry data from Sysmon, and using this data to detect and investigate security incidents.
- <strong>Understanding of cyber attack simulation and detection:</strong> Simulating cyber attacks using Kali Linux and learning how to detect these attacks through the data collected by Splunk.
- <strong>Experience in building a secure virtual network:</strong> Setting up a secure and functional network environment using VirtualBox, enhancing my overall understanding of network security principles.
